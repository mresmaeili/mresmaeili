## Overview

In this project, I translated a Figma design into a fully responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating GSAP for smooth animations and interactive elements to elevate the user experience.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Developed a set of modular, reusable UI components with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating GSAP for animations to enhance interactivity and smooth transitions.
- **Responsive Design**: Focused on accessibility and responsiveness, ensuring the website looks great and functions well across all devices and screen sizes..
- **Figma-Driven Development**: Worked closely with designers to translate a detailed Figma design into code, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy and consistency with the original design vision.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Core technologies for structure, styling, and interactivity.
- **GSAP**: For high-performance animations and dynamic elements that elevate user experience.

## Challenges and Learnings

Balancing smooth animations with fast load times presented a challenge, addressed by optimizing GSAP animations and carefully planning animation triggers. Collaborating effectively with designer in Figma streamlined the design-to-development workflow, minimizing discrepancies between design and final output.

## Outcome

The website's animation-driven design and responsive layout provided an engaging user experience, with smooth, interactive elements that met the original Figma design specifications. The development process also strengthened collaboration and established a foundation for future animation-driven projects.
